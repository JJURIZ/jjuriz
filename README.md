### About Me 
My journey started as a support technician at Entech Data Systems in 2002. In addition to support I performed QA, documentation, and training duties. After several years as a support tech I shifted to team management for nearly a decade.

Management experience taught me how to work productively with others, how to lead a team, and to have confidence in myself. It also opened the door to work directly with a software development team. Helping shape the future of software drove me like nothing before. When a Product Owner role opened up I jumped at the opportunity.

For the last 5 years I've worn several hats - Product Line Manager, User Experience Designer, and Product Owner. The more time I spent working with developers, the more I realized they were doing what I wanted to be doing.

In 2019 I began learning web development in earnest. It is the most rewarding endeavor I've undertaken. I am excited to plunge further into the ocean of software engineering.
